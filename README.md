# work-day-scheduler-man

## This Word Day Scheduler, written with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and using moment.js, local storage, and jQuery, lets the user input tasks that correspond to times of the day and save them by clicking a SAVE button. Those tasks persist and will still be there after the user refreshes the page.

# The page uses moment.js to establish the current date and display it at the top of the page. Then, it uses moment.js to compare the current time with the time corresponding to each task and color-codes those tasks that are in the past, present, and future.

This was a challenging Challenge. I ran into a lot of roadblocks, one of which was dealing with local storage and figuring out how to call back things that had been stored there. I also made a bit of a mistake at the start of the project, constructing the HTML for each task entry at each time instead of creating those dynamically with Javascript. This made it difficult to pinpoint which task at which time I wanted.
